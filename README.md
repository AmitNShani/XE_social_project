# XE_social_project
During last college summer semester, I took part in this social project. The purpose of the project is to build a website for the use of the “Rehovot’s parents committee. I was responsible of creating the “XpertEsy” backend code. XpertEsy is a web program that helps to communicate with multiple users. And uses a white board for meeting or learning online.
